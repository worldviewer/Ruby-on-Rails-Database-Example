# Todo List with Rails
## Assignment
Build a todo list with Rails. You are going to need:

- A `Todo` model with the attribute `description`
- A `TodosController` with an index and a create action
- Routes to `todos#index` and `todos#create`
- A view in app/views/todos called index.html.erb, rendered by the `TodosController`, that renders a list of all todos and a form underneath to add a new todo

## Bonus
Make it so that you can update todos! Add an attribute called `complete` to your todos table, which is a boolean that defaults to true (you will need to research how to do that). You will also need an extra form to update a todo.
